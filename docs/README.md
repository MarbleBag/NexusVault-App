# NexusVault CLI
Version 0.2.0

A CLI application which incorporates the [NexusVault library](https://github.com/MarbleBag/NexusVault/tree/java)
In its current form it mainly provides a way to traverse the content of .archive files and export its content, either in its original form or converted to a more known format.



### Getting started

Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/MarbleBag/NexusVault-CLI/releases/latest).
The release comes prepacked with all needed dependencies (except Java) and a launch4j launcher, which supports to run the application without a Java installation, as long as it can find a valid JRE besides it. 

A Windows compatible Java version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/MarbleBag/NexusVault-CLI/releases/tag/v0.1.5.beta), packed as JRE_11_small_WIN64.zip

```Bash
├── NexusVaultCLI
   ├── jre  <---
   ├── libs
   ├── nexusvault-cli.jar
   └── NexusvaultCLI.exe
```

Is no local Java version provide, the launcher will look up Java installations that are available on the system.

### Run the application
Before anything can be done, the application needs to know which archives should be read, to do so either start the application with the flag `-a "path to folder"`, either via shortcut or batch/shell script, or write `archive "path to folder"` after starting it.

The application will immediately search for any archives there. It is also possible to load a specific archive by passing the direct file path to the application.
 
Console examples:
* `-a "C:\Games\WildStar"`
* `archive "C:\Games\Wildstar"`
* `-a "C:\Games\WildStar\Patch\ClientData.archive" "C:\Games\WildStar\Patch\ClientDataEN.archive"`
